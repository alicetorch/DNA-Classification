# DNA-Classification
Use PCA and numpy to classify different species by plotting their DNA on a 3D diagram
Get the DNA of different animals that need to be classified (these DNA are arranged based on their positions); 

step 1: change these DNA series in form of "ATCG" into "0" and "1", which can be understand by computer

step 2: rearrange these series based on which species they belong to

step 3: write these DNA into a csv sheet

step 4: plot them in a 3D diagram using PCA
